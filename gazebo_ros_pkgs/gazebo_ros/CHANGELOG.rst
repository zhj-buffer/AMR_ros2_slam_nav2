Changelog for package gazebo_ros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.5.3 (2021-04-15)
------------------
* Update default spawn_service_timeout to be consistent with other ROS2 distros (`#1264 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1264>`_)
  * update default timeout value to be consistent with other ROS2 distros
  * define timeout as a constant
* Fix executor to avoid random exceptions when shutting down (`#1212 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1212>`_)
  * Fix executor to avoid random exceptions when shutting down
  * Add link to related issue in rclcpp
* ros2: Only subscribe to /gazebo/performance_metrics when necessary (`#1205 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1205>`_)
  We are currently subscribing to the /gazebo/performance_metrics topic
  even if there are no subscribers to the ROS topic forwarding this data.
  This changes gazebo_ros_init to only subscribe to the gazebo topic
  if there are any subscribers to the corresponding ROS topic.
  While advertiser callbacks are used in ROS 1 but are not yet in ROS2,
  here we use polling in the GazeboRosInitPrivate::PublishSimTime
  callback to check for subscribers since it is called for each Gazebo
  time step.
  This also helps workaround the deadlock documented in `#1175 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1175>`_ and
  `osrf/gazebo#2902 <https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/issues/2902>`_.
  This also adds a macro to reduce duplication of the version checking
  logic.
* colcon.pkg: build gazebo first in colcon workspace (`#1192 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1192>`_)
  Add a colcon.pkg file to gazebo_dev with gazebo's cmake project
  name "Gazebo" listed as a dependency to support building
  gazebo from source in a colcon workspace.
  * Add colcon.pkg files for other packages
  Copy colcon.pkg to gazebo_ros, gazebo_plugins, and
  gazebo_ros_control so that --merge-install won't be required.
* [ROS 2] Bridge to republish PerformanceMetrics in ROS 2 (`#1147 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1147>`_)
* [Windows] Add missing visibility control. (`#1150 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1150>`_)
* [ros2] Enable the force system on launch files (`#1035 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1035>`_)
* make compile wo/ warnings on osx (`#1149 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1149>`_)
* Added lockstep argument to gzserver (`#1146 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1146>`_)

3.5.0 (2020-06-19)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#1130 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1130>`_ from ros-simulation/foxy_tests
  Fix all Foxy tests
* Merge pull request `#1129 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1129>`_ from ros-simulation/e_to_f_june_2020
  Eloquent ➡️ Foxy
* Dashing -> Eloquent
* [ROS 2] Use "" as default in spawn_entity.py instead of self.get_namespace(). (`#1117 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1117>`_)
* Fix flake8 failures (`#1110 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1110>`_)
* Add gazebo_ros::QoS class (`#1091 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1091>`_)
  Contains logic for parsing <qos> SDF elements and creating rclcpp::QoS objects for ROS publishers and subscriptions.
  Co-authored-by: Ivan Santiago Paunovic <ivanpauno@ekumenlabs.com>
* [eloquent] Fix Windows build. (`#1077 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1077>`_)
* 3.3.5
* [forward port to Foxy] Add node required parameter to launch (`#1074 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1074>`_)  (`#1086 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1086>`_)
* Use configurable timeout in other wait for service calls (`#1073 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1073>`_)
  * Use configurable timeout in other wait for service calls
  Follow-up to `#1072 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1072>`_
* Increase spawn entity wait for service timeout (`#1072 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1072>`_)
  If we have a reaonsable complex launch file and lots of DDS discovery traffic, sometimes five seconds isn't enough.
  This change makes the timeout configurable and changes the default timeout to thirty seconds.
* Uncrustify (`#1060 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1060>`_)
  Style changes to conform to the new default setting introduced in https://github.com/ament/ament_lint/pull/210.
  Arguments that do not fit on one line must start on a new line.
* [ros2] make transient local reliable (`#1033 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/1033>`_)

  For example, a launch file like the following wouldn't work without this change:
  <launch>
  <arg name="model_urdf" default="$(find-pkg-share mymodels)/urdf/ball.urdf" />
  <node

2.4.1 (2013-11-13)
------------------

2.3.5 (2014-03-26)
------------------
* gazebo_ros: [less-than-minor] fix newlines
* gazebo_ros: remove assignment to self
  If this is needed for any twisted reason, it should be made clear
  anyway. Assuming this line is harmless and removing it because it
  generates cppcheck warnings.
* Contributors: Paul Mathieu

2.3.4 (2013-11-13)
------------------
* rerelease because sdformat became libsdformat, but we also based change on 2.3.4 in hydro-devel.
* remove debug statement
* fix sdf spawn with initial pose
* fix sdf spawn with initial pose
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into ``spawn_model_pose_fix``
* fix indentation
* Merge pull request `#142 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/142>`_ from hsu/hydro-devel
  fix issue `#38 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/38>`_, gui segfault on model deletion
* Merge pull request `#140 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/140>`_ from ``v4hn/spawn_model_sleep``
  replace time.sleep by rospy.Rate.sleep
* fix spawn initial pose.  When model has a non-zero initial pose and user specified initial model spawn pose, add the two.
* fix issue `#38 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/38>`_, gui segfault on model deletion by removing an obsolete call to set selected object state to "normal".
* replace time.sleep by rospy.Rate.sleep
  time was not even imported, so I don't know
  why this could ever have worked...
* Add time import
  When using the -wait option the script fails because is missing the time import

2.3.2 (2013-09-19)
------------------
* Make gazebo includes use full path
  In the next release of gazebo, it will be required to use the
  full path for include files. For example,
  `include <physics/physics.hh>` will not be valid
  `include <gazebo/physics/physics.hh>` must be done instead.
* update gazebo includes
* Fixed a minor typo in spawn_model error message when `-model` not specified

------------------

2.2.0 (2013-07-29)
