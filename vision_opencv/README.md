ros2 vison_opencv contains packages to interface ROS2 with [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) which is a library designed for computational efficiency and strong focus for real time computer vision applications. What package it contains:
* `cv_bridge`: Bridge between ROS2 image messages and OpenCV image representation
* `image_geometry`: Collection of methods for dealing with image and pixel geometry
* `opencv_tests`: Integration tests to use the capability of the packages with opencv
