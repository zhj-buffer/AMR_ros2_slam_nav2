# ros2-driver-for-yhs-moving-base
This is the ros2 version driver work for YHS moving base build and test with ROS2 Foxy and Galactic

CAN to USB is required and the default interface working with this moving base.

Before the test, pls refer to the documents for USB setup on Ubuntu.

NOTE: pls source your ROS2_DISTRO

# step 1:
```
mkdir dev_ws
cd dev_ws
mkdir src && cd src
git clone https://github.com/zhj-buffer/ros2-driver-for-yhs-moving-base.git
```
# step 2:
```
sudo cp ros2_drive_package_can_ctrol/include/ros2_drive_package_can_ctrol/libcontrolcan.so  /usr/lib/
```
# step 3:
```
cd ..
colcon build
```
# step 4:
```
source install/setup.bash
